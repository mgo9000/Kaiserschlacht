Kaiserschlacht is a horror RPG set in the last days of the first World War, and this Foundry VTT integration makes learning the already-simple rules a breeze!

Automated skill checks, damage application, status effect expiration, and more, are already implemented, and many more features are incoming.

To update a skill or attribute's value, simply click on the value on the character sheet. To roll a skill or saving throw, click on the name of the skill or attribute. On the combat page, you can Take Cover, Block, and Dodge with dedicated buttons, and roll attacks by clicking the name of an equipped weapon. Damage application can then be applied from the chat card with the result (by a user with permissions to update the token which will be damaged - usually the GM.)

Because NPCs automatically hit, can apply damage directly from the damage entry on their character sheets.

Coming soon: more compendium content, V12 support, proper automation for the Prone status effect, quickstart documentation.
