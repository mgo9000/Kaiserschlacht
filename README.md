Kaiserschlacht is a horror RPG set in the last days of the first World War, and this Foundry VTT integration makes learning the already-simple rules a breeze!

Automated skill checks, damage application, status effect expiration, and more, are already implemented, and many more features are incoming.

Coming soon: more compendium content, V12 support, proper automation for the Prone status effect, quickstart documentation.
