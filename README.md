Kaiserschlacht is a horror RPG set in the last days of the first World War, and this Foundry VTT integration makes learning the already-simple rules a breeze!

Automated skill checks, damage application, status effect expiration, and more, are already implemented, and many more features are incoming.

Forthcoming will be compendium content for the upcoming playtest, and some video explanations of the system's features.
